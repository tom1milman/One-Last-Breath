### The Game
In our lives, we breath without even thinking about it. Our body controls it. 
What would happen if we put our body in a situation it cannot control? 

As a lost scuba diver, you will have to look for air bubbles to breathe.
Be aware of the different animals that are in the cave with you, some will try to eat you!
#### Just one last breath!

My main goal for this game is to work with procedural generation, which I use for the map.
